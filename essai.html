			<h2>Vision statement</h2>
		<p>Jet lag is a common problem for many travelers and for many workers. This AmI can help the user getting used to the new circadian rhythm.</p>
		<p>The systeme will be used in hotel's room. It will help people that come from a far away country for profesional reasons or not. the user will just have to answer some questions to help the system to calculate how many time and how the user needs to sleep. The user will receive some advice to help him with the new circadian rhythm.</p>
		<p> The problem is that people that often travel are tired because they do not sleep at the right time because they used to sleep at a precise time in their country. Here we propose a solution to permit to the user to sleep at a precise time. Like this, it will be easier for him to get used to the new circadian rhythme.</p>

					<td>The ami system is capable to use the data in the smartphone (google agenda,...) to know what are the obligations of the user. It will also give advice to the user by using a telegram bot, notifications or microphone (not decided yet). Some sensors will be used to close the blinds or switch off/on the lights. </td>

				<tr>

		<h2>Open issues</h2>
			<p>

				To suceed in doing this project, we will need to get access to the smartphone of the user especially we will use the google agenda and the alarm menu. After that, we need to calculate, thanks to the data given by the user, the best way for him to sleep and to accustom himself to the circadian rhythm of the region. We will need to use bluetooth or wifi technologie to control the lamps of the room and the blinders . We will also use a telegram bot, notifications of the phone or a microphone to interract with the user.</p>
